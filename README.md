# 🚀 Dotfiles Setup
Welcome to my personal dotfiles setup! This is the configuration I use to supercharge my developer workflow on macOS, and soon on Linux (Arch with Hyprland) and Windows(i am not sure about this).

## 📦 Platforms

* **🖥️ macOS** – Fully supported and automated via [INSTALL\_MAC.md](./INSTALL_MAC.md).
* **🐧 Linux (Arch + Hyprland)** – Coming soon(i forgot to push in the github)...
* **🪟 Windows** – Coming soon(hope so)...

## 🧠 What's Included

* Neovim with LazyVim as the base (fully modular, fast, and extensible)
* Zsh with Oh My Zsh and useful plugins
* tmux with sensible defaults and plugin manager
* Custom keymaps, aliases, and utilities

## ⚙️ macOS Installation

To get started on **macOS**, read the [INSTALL\_MAC.md](./INSTALL_MAC.md) guide.
It will:
* Install Homebrew and essential packages
* Clone this dotfiles repo
* Symlink all config files (like `~/.config/nvim`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)
* Set up LazyVim
* Configure Zsh, tmux, and more
